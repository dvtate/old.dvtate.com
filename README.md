My personal website

  I first started develpment on this website in 2014. It was intended as a way for me to share a small program I made for math class, but I gradually got more advanced in web development and added more pages and drastically improved the appearance of the site. However recently (2016), I've gotten addicted to lower-level languages like C/C++ and this project has been put on the back burner. I'm still adding new material, but slowly. 

  After my parents told me I'm not allowed to go out with my gf anymore, I had to move my website off of her VPS, so now I recognize the importance of backups, I decided to post my source (sensitive files removed). So that way I could get reccomendations, and perhaps some guidance since I know I'm doing a great many things wrong.

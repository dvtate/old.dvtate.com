# dvtate.com
  This repo is for my [old] personal website. My current one, [me.dvtate.com](https://github.com/dvtate.github.io) is more streamlined for contact information and isn't as personalized.

  I first started develpment on this website in 2014. It was intended as a way for me to share a small program I made for math class, but I gradually got more advanced in web development and added more pages and drastically improved the appearance of the site. In 2016 I shifted focus towards lower level programming languages. I kept gradually adding material to this site until around 2018 when I decided to remove it from the internet.

## Hosting
- This website is no longer hosted (php5 == security vulnerability)
- Previously was hosted on these places:
  - ex gf's server: until parents made us separate
  - 000webhost.com: until they got hacked
    + you can see how I disabled their ads
  - home server: until php5 became obsolete

## Profile Page
This website is outdated, but still contains some relevant information and content. I now plan on sharing [me.dvtate.com](https://dvtate.github.io) instead of this website.

## Licensing
The code is covered under GPLv3, but the content and rendered site are covered under CC0

My personal website

<p>I first started develpment on this website in 2014. It was intended as a way for me to share a small program I made for math class, but I gradually got more advanced in web development and added more pages and drastically improved the appearance of the site. However recently (2016), I've gotten addicted to lower-level languages like C/C++ and this project has been put on the back burner. I'm still adding new material, but slowly. </p>
<p>After my parents told me I'm not allowed to go out with my gf anymore, I had to move my website off of her VPS, so now I recognize the importance of backups, I decided to post my source (sensitive files removed). So that way I could get reccomendations, and perhaps some guidance since I know I'm doing a great many things wrong. <b>If you would like to contribute, please open up an issue since I want all of the code to be made by me.</b></p>

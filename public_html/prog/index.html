			<h2><strong>How  I got Started</strong></h2>

			<ul>
				<p class="ind">I first started playing with HTML when I was in the 6<sup><u>th</u></sup> grade. I made a web page for a social studies project. Next year (2012) I started on my first programming language - <a href="//dvtate.com/prog/basic" >BASIC</a>. I made a  console based game for a <a href="//dvtate.com/prog/basic/math.html">math project</a>. I soon realized that BASIC had practically no use and lacked some important features, so I decided to learn <a href="//dvtate.com/prog/cpp" >C++</a>, as I had seen many resources for it on the internet, and it seemed interesting. After making console C++ programs until summer 2013, my uncle, gave me a book on <a href="//dvtate.com/prog/vbs">VBScript</a>. I created a number of	applications. My last full VBScript application was a (somewhat faulty) triangle area calculator. Wanting to share it with my friends in the summer of 2014, (email said no) I decided to make a website using ASP classic(VBS), but after my idea of running a home server was shotdown, I couldn't find a host that would take it. I converted it into <a href="//dvtate.com/prog/php" >PHP</a>, and it became my website. After a couple of years of evolution, this website has gotten to its current state. I have made it essentially from scratch, without using others' premade templates, I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and PHP on the server-side. In my computer class, I had to learn python and I've used Java in <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/aeronautics/community-relations/codequest.html" target="_blank" >Code Quest</a>, in addition to my AP Computer Science class. As the programmer on my local <a href="http://www3.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc" target="_blank">FRC robotics</a> team, (<a href="https://robobibb.github.io/" target="_blank">RoboBibb #4941</a>) I had to learn LabView when C++ wouldn't install correctly. There was a gradual transition during the second half of 2015 in which I became less interested in web-development and more interested in C/C++ and low-level development. I can <span title="2016.11.06">now</span> say that I have more experience/skill in C/C++ than any other language. In addition to numerous projects using Arduinos, I began developing a <a href="https://github.com/dvtate/rpn/" title="the github repo where you can find this project">stack-based scripting language</a> using C/C++. My ultimate goal for this hobby is to program embedded systems for a living in the future. During the 2017 robotics competition, my programming projects grew massively. I worked on computer vision for our robot's autonomous, and lead <a href="https://github.com/robobibb/robobibb.github.io" target="_blank">the development of the teams new website</a>, both of these have pushed my limits and given me more ideas on other projects to test my skills.</p>

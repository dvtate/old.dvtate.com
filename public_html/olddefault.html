			<h3 class="subtitle"><u>About Me</u>:</h3>
			<p class="ind" id="who" name="about-tate" >I'm a 9<sup><u>th</u></sup> grader at Howard High School. My full name is Dustin Van Tate Testa, but everyone calls me Tate.
			</p>
			<h3 class="subtitle"><u>My Hobbies</u>:</h3>
			<p class="ind" id="myshorthistory" >
				I started learning my second language (Danish) in 5<sup><u>th</u></sup> grade. I also played with model air planes, this lead me to
				start playing with electronics in 6<sup><u>th</u></sup> grade. By the next year, I had started playing with my first programming language
				(BASIC), and quickly moved on to <a href="//dvtate.com/prog/cpp" >C++</a>. Later on that year I established my lab in my family's attic where I began experimenting in chemistry. By the
				spring of 2013 I had created an operational foundry on my parents' empty lot, which I continue to use as my primary source of income. 
				Since the 5<sup><u>th</u></sup> grade I've been making 3D models in SketchUp I recently (as of summer of 2014) I started with an 
				open-source application called Wings3D. Combining my modelling software, and my programming through unity, I am working on a video game.

			<h3 class="subtitle"><u>About this Website</u>:</h3>
			<p class="ind" id="site-par" name="webhistory" >
				In the spring of 2014, I created a program in VBScript which finds the area between any 3 coordinates. Most of the kids in my math class
				wanted a copy of it. I attempted to send it via email, but Gmail wouldn't let me send it. So I converted it to HTA, ASP, and finally PHP (I had 
				never heard of JavaScript). This was my first addition to this website. You can still visit it 
				<a  href="//dvtate.com/prog/php/tri.php" > here </a> (or<a id="oldtricalc" href="//dvtate.com/prog/php/oldtri.php"> here</a>
				for the original prototype). I continued to add more pages for all of my hobbies.

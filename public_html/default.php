		<p>Big thanks to my friend in China for letting me use their VPS. I Will slowly be adding the website, but the process will be far slower than before as I now don't have a backup of the old site to upload. I expect to have most of the pages up before the new year, but this could change.<br/>Thanks for the pacience!</p>

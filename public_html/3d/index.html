			<h2><b>How I got started</b>:</h2>
			<ul><p class="ind">I was introduced to 3D modeling in the 5<sup>th</sup> grade when I saw one of my friends on the school's computer using Google(now Trimble) SketchUp. I thought it looked cool, so I went home and put it on my computer and made some models. I used the software to do projects, and for fun. In the 7<sup>th</sup> grade, my modelling got better, and I decided to make a new dreamhouse (dreamhouse5), in addition to a project. I'm still working on that dreamhouse (currently<!--6/10--> 34.3 MB). In 8<sup>th</sup> grade, I decided i wanted to make a video game. Because SketchUp is proprietary software, I couldn't make money off a game which included models I made in SketchUp. So I found <a href="http://wings3d.com" target="_blank">Wings 3D</a> I quickly learned the software over the summer via tutorials. In the 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I joined the robotics team. We won a 3D printer, and using Wings 3D, I was able to make models for printing. I also started a project which used Blender, one of the best 3D modelling software out there, but it was too hard so I stuck to Wings. Over the summer of 2015(9<sup>th</sup> grade), I began playing with CGI (computer generated images), attempting to make realistic models and then render them using POV Ray. I've made some pretty cool stuff.</p></ul>

			<p class="ind">SketchUp is an easy to use tool based 3D modeling software, aimed at the general public, the main field that uses this software extensively is the architecture and design fields as they need to make a model quick and easy for a job. One of the most noteable features in sketchup is the 3D ware house, a collection of 3D models which you can add to your project (cheat).</p>

			<p class="ind">Wings 3D is an advanced subdivision modeler. It is built in erlang a concurrent functional language making it fast and cross platform compatible, in addition, Wings 3D is open-source software, making it a great tool. For me it is easy to use once you get the keyboard shortcuts down. Wings is best for small individual models as opposed to large complex projects. Wings has plugins which export to rendering engines like POV Ray, making it good for CGI. I feel that wings is a simpler, less capable, and easier to learn alternative to Blender.</p>

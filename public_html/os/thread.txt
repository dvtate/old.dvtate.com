<div class="mine">Hi Guys,<br/>Please choose up to four operating systems for me to write about, I already have plans to write about the four in the tabs on this page, but if you really like one please feel free to recommend it anyway. I might make a poll based on the most popular choices. If you have any recommendations for the website or want to discuss your chosen operating system, please feel free to talk in <a href="http://dvtate.ga/chat/">the chatroom</a>.<ul>-Tate</ul></div><br/>
